# Logic-Lens — Developer Guide (Claude Code)

This file contains instructions for Claude when working on the Logic-Lens repository itself.

## Conventions

### SKILL.md Structure
- YAML frontmatter: `name` and `description` are required.
- `description` must include a "Do NOT trigger for:" clause.
- `description` should be explicit about trigger phrases — err on the side of triggering.
- Process section: 5–7 numbered items; each item cites a step in the guide file.
- Setup section: explicit `Read` instructions for each shared file and the guide.

### Guide Files
- Numbered steps (Step 1, Step 2, ...).
- Each step explains the *why*, not just the *what*.
- Sub-steps use letters (Step 2a, 2b).
- Concrete examples preferred over abstract descriptions.

### Risk Codes
- Built-in: L1–L6 (defined in `skills/_shared/logic-risks.md`)
- Custom project-specific: C1, C2, ... (defined in `.logic-lens.yaml` at the repo root — optional file, omit if no custom codes needed)
- Every finding must be tagged with a risk code.

`.logic-lens.yaml` schema: see `skills/_shared/common.md` — `custom_risks` is a list of records with `code`, `name`, `description`, and `severity` fields.

### Version Sync
`package.json` is the source of truth for the version number. When bumping version, update:
1. `package.json` → `version`
2. `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` → `version`
3. `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` → `version`
4. `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` → `version`
5. `gemini-extension.json` → `version`
6. `README.md` → version badge

### Iron Law
Never add a Remedy to a finding before Premises, Trace, and Divergence are written. This is the core discipline of the project. Do not weaken it.

## Companion Docs by AI Tool

| File | Read by | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `AGENTS.md` | OpenAI Codex / Agents SDK | Task instructions for agent-based runners |
| `GEMINI.md` | Gemini CLI | Extension setup and skill invocation for Gemini |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Human contributors | Ground rules, versioning policy, PR requirements |

## Development Commands

> **Note:** `scripts/` is not yet committed — all three commands below will fail until it is created.

```bash
npm run validate   # Validate repo structure and metadata consistency
npm run evals      # Run eval suite against recorded expected outputs (offline)
npm run evals:live # Run eval suite with a live model call (costs tokens)
```

## Commands in This Repo

Claude Code users invoke skills as `/logic-review`, `/logic-explain`, etc.
The session-start hook copies these from `commands/` to `~/.claude/commands/` automatically.

## Adding a New Skill
1. Create `skills/logic-newskill/SKILL.md` following the existing SKILL.md pattern.
2. Create `skills/logic-newskill/logic-newskill-guide.md`.
3. Add a command wrapper to `commands/logic-newskill.md`.
4. Register in `gemini-extension.json` contribution.skills and contribution.commands.
5. No change needed in `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` — it points at `skills/` directory and auto-discovers subfolders.
6. Add the skill name to the `for skill in ...` loop in `hooks/session-start` (line ~10).
7. Add 3–5 eval cases to `evals/evals.json`.
